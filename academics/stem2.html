			<h1>Course Description</h1>
			During STEM 2, we work in groups of three to four people with the folks at Seven Hills and Easter Seals to produce specialized assistive technology for our clients there. I worked on this project with <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~janderson/index.html" class="link">Jackie</a> and <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~tkjayaswal/index.html" class="link">Toyesh</a>.</p>

			<h1>Problem Description</h1>
			Spinal cord injuries are a broad class of injuries that involve damage of the spinal cord which transmits signals to and from the brain. These injuries often result in limited motor function, making it difficult for the patient to move the muscles in their arms, hands, feet, and legs. ​This can make it challenging for these individuals to complete daily tasks independently, such as brushing their teeth, writing, typing, and even playing music. ​The goal of this project is to design a device that will allow these individuals to independently play an instrument and produce music.​</p>
		</div>

			<h1>Approach</h1>
			First we came up with three different project ideas: a guitar pick, a trombone slide controller, and a piano pedal pusher. We modelled these in CAD and then performed stress analysis on them to aid in deciding which of three designs should be further modelled into a prototype. This ultimately ended being the piano pedal pusher. Our goal with this project was to improve the experience of playing an existing device. We decided to focus on helping patients with limited range of motion in their legs to play music on the piano while utilizing pedals. The model works by signaling for motors to extend and retract cylinders which will push down pedals. The motors would be connected to an Arduino where each motor is connected to an associated button. When the button is pressed, the motor would rotate one way to push down the pedal and when the button is released, the cylinder would retract and allow the pedal to go back. Below is the requirements document that helped us decide which project to pursue.</p>

				<h1>Design 2.1</h1>
				The initial prototype only included the base, without any sort of pushing mechanism, but the intended pushing mechanism was three pistons, one at each circular hole.</p>

				<h1>Design 2.2</h1>
				This design added the pistons to Design 2.1. Though these aren’t real pistons, they illustrate what actual pistons would look like if attached to Design 2.1.</p>

		<div class="contain">
			<div class="firsthalf">
				<h1>Design 2.3</h1>
				This design changed the method of pushing down the pedal from a piston to a gear. The gears aren't finished, but they have been started. Additionally, the middle and right piano pedal pushing plates have been created and a detachable connector that secures the piano pedal pusher has been implemented.</p>

				<h1>Design 2.4</h1>
				The final design uses gears to change the positions of the piano pedal pushers. These piano pedal pushers consist of a block with a piano pedal imprint underneath them, which are attached to a rod with teeth on the top of it, which connects to the motor which causes the rod to go both up and down. Electrical components still need to be added for the device to function.</p>

				&emsp;&emsp;The final device uses gears to change the positions of the piano pedal pushers. These piano pedal pushers consist of a block with a piano pedal imprint underneath them, which are attached to a rod with teeth on the top of it, which connects to the motor which causes the rod to go both up and down. We printed out the design, had to adjust a few things, and then added the electrical components for the device to function. The piano pedal pusher hasn't been tested on a piano yet, but preliminary tests indicate that it may be too weak to push down a piano pedal.​</p>
				&emsp;&emsp;In the near future, we hope to continue progressing this project and make some improvements for a more complete final design. After running more tests, we would like to make any necessary updates the design requires, and produce a more finalized product. Then, we would like to be able to meet with the Seven Hills staff and clients to show them our product and get feedback. Our end goal would be to produce a fully functioning final design that can be used at Seven Hills to help clients play the piano and provide them with a positive music experience. </p>
