			At the beginning of CS class, the whole class made these websites together, and then in B Term, I started my independent project. In between these two points in time, I spent most of class time solving challenge problems, such as those from the Euler Project. This is one of the challenge problems.</p>

			My independent project is an pixelized tower defense game based on daily life in MAMS. I want the game to have towers specializing in various subjects, with the incoming sprites being various assignments that we have to do throughout the year. I have some basics down already, but I still have a lot that I need to develop. Here are snapshots of what I currently have.</p>

			During D Term, we worked in groups of three to four people on the Apps for Good project, where each group makes an app to solve a problem. My group, <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~semani/index.html" class="link">Anvi</a>, <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~ayarlagadda/index.html" class="link">Akhi</a>, and I, chose to make an app that would help people be more conscious of their carbon usage. It's called Carbon Truth, and we made it through Android Studio. You can find a demo of the app <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DtMCqGs8OHYq9U8wT5NGkKnX36eIwCCL/view?usp=sharing" class="link">here</a>, and below is a presentation summarizing our process and how to use the app.</p>
			Despite arguments over whether or not global warming is real, it comes as no doubt that the atmosphere is filled with more negative and dangerous heat now than ever before. Among the reasons for the earth warming so drastically are carbon emissions, and this is where our app comes in. CarbonTruth aims to help individual consumers track their carbon footprint in order for them to make the most environmentally conscious decisions. Our app will allow users to see their personal carbon footprints, as well as compare them to other users and to the worldwide averages. Our app can also be used to create healthy competition between large groups of people in order to enhance environmental consciousness. This app will be used on both Apple and Android platforms. This app targets individuals who wish to track their carbon usage in order to do their part in minimizing greenhouse effects.</p>
