				Here's the very first official essay that we had to write for Hum. It is based on two of Ray Bradbury's short stories, <i>The Pedestrian</i> and <i>August 2026: There Will Come Soft Rains</i>. Both of these stories are dystopian in nature, and I chose to look at how they were structured in order to convey their overall theme.</p>

				This is the essay that I wrote for our satire unit, in which we analyzed Jonathan Swift's <i>A Modest Proposal</i>, as well as a variety of different satirical pieces. In this essay, I looked at how effective two pieces of writing with the same goal but different literary styles (satirical vs. article) were.</p>

				Here's the creative writing satire piece that <a href="http://users.wpi.edu/~ahmiller/index.html" class="link">Alec</a> and I made. It centers around the fictional persona of "Cody G", an entitled teenager who has been born into a wealthy family. The piece of satire is meant to address the problems of legacy admissions and the series of college admissions scandals that were recent at the time. </p>

				Here's one of the last essays I wrote for Hum. It takes a look at the differences and similarities between how conflict is portrayed in both Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and Euripides' <i>Women of Troy.</i></p>
