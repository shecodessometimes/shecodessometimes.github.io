				SISPs are 100 hour independent study projects in which seniors at Mass Academy learn about a topic of their choice. For my SISP I decided to focus on 3D game design, as I have experience with building 2D games, but had always wanted to know how that would work in three dimensions. I've completed a little over 40 hours of the project, and throughout my project, I've learned a lot about Unity and Blender, and how to use them.</p>

				Here's an early model of the game. At this point, I was still familiarizing myself with Unity, and really just layed down the basics for what I wanted the user interface for the game to be. You can see that I haven't really developed the art for the game, and that it isn't very engaging.</p>

				This is what that same scene looked like once I'd come up with a concept for the art style and had created the art assets for the game. It's where I'm currently at, and for the rest of the project, I'm going to develop the storyline of the game further, and determine exactly why this character is on this alien island.</p>

				Here's a breakdown of what I've done in my project so far. I had never really used Blender before, so learning about all of the different ways you can use Blender to make art was really insightful for me, and I'm glad that I know how to use it now. I decided against making a hyperealistic game because of simply how much time it takes to model even a single piece, but making a hyperealistic face could be a cool project in the future.</p>
