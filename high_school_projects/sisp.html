				SISPs are 100 hour independent study projects in which seniors at Mass Academy learn about a topic of their choice. For my SISP I decided to focus on 3D game design, as I have experience with building 2D games, but had always wanted to know how that would work in three dimensions. Over the course of the 100 hours I had, I learned so much about the basics of game design in Unity and how Blender could be used with it to make custom assets .</p>

				Here's an early model of the game. At this point, I was still familiarizing myself with Unity, and was focusing on laying down the basics for what I wanted the user interface of the game to be. You can see that I haven't really developed the art for the game, and that it isn't very engaging.</p>

				This is what that same scene looked like once I'd come up with a concept for the art style and had created the art assets for the game.</p>

				Here's a breakdown of what I've done in my project so far. I had never really used Blender before, so learning about all of the different ways you can use Blender to make art was really insightful for me, and I'm glad that I know how to use it now. I decided against making a hyperealistic game because of simply how much time it takes to model even a single piece, but making a hyperealistic face could be a cool project in the future.</p>

				This is the final product, with some dialogue and an option to switch between different "worlds". It isn't very polished, but even so, through the course of making it, and over the course of my SISP as a whole, I learned so much.
