			<h4>Overview</h4>
			I chose to do a stem project in astronomy. While searching for
			possible questions that I could try to solve, I found that although
			over 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered, no exomoons have been
			confirmed.
		</div>
		<div class="blob">
			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			Even though hundreds of moons exist in our solar system, and over
			four thousand planets have been found outside of the solar system, no
			extrasolar moons have been confirmed. The main method used by
			researchers to detect exoplanets has been transiting, which utilises
			changes in the parent star’s light as the exoplanet passes across its
			disk. The objective of this project is to help find exomoons by
			utilising patterns found by modelling a planet-moon-sun system into
			an algorithm that finds a suitable match for a given system. First, a
			model with adjustable orbital parameters was made using VPython
			through the GlowScript 2.9 IDE. Then, the TTVs and TDVs of different
			orbital parameters were analyzed using Java Eclipse. However, no
			direct correlation between different orbital parameters and TTVs and
			TDVs were found. Future extensions would include rewriting the three
			body model and coding an algorithm that takes these variations and
			find possible exomoons in readily available exoplanetary data.
		</div>
		<div class="blob">
			<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
			Though over 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered so far, and over a
			hundred moons exist in the solar system, no exomoons have ever been
			confirmed.

		</div>
		<div class="blob">
			<h4>Overall Aim</h4>
			The overall aim of this project is to engineer a way to detect
			exomoons in a transit curve. The goal is to find a correlation
			between changes in the orbital parameters of an exomoon and the
			resulting TTV and TDVs of the system.
		</div>
		<div class="blob" style="height: 500px;">
			<h4>Background</h4>
			&emsp;&emsp;Ever since antiquity, humankind has looked to the stars
			for inspiration and the answer to the burning question of: Are we
			alone? As the field of astronomy has progressed, this question has
			been in the center of it. Advancements such as being able to detect
			elements using spectroscopy, and understanding more about how our
			solar system was formed have created a basis for the current study of
			exoplanets, the focus of modern astrobiology. However, exoplanets
			should not be the end-all be-all in the search for extraterrestrial
			life. Exomoons are also viable options, as seen with the numerous
			moons in our own solar system that are potentially habitable.
			</p>
			&emsp;&emsp;Exoplanetary science has evolved under the assumption
			that Earth and our solar system are not special cases. It is assumed
			that there exist other planets around stars that could potentially be
			habitable by life. The very first exoplanet found orbiting around a
			sun-like star, 51 Pegasib, was discovered in 1997 (Marcy, 1997) by
			finding the wobble of the star that was caused by the planet. Since
			then, more methods for finding exoplanets have been employed. The
			most successful, the transiting method, has found thousands of
			exoplanets, most notably through data collected by NASA’s Kepler
			spacecraft. The transiting method measures the amount of light
			emitted from a star over a certain interval of time. This is then
			graphed, resulting in a “transit curve”. Researchers then look for
			periodic dips in the data, known as “transits”, which are indicative
			of an exoplanet orbiting the star. This method finds the period,
			radius, and semi-major axis of the exoplanet’s orbit, but needs to be
			cross-referenced with another method of detection in order to prove
			that the exoplanet exists. There are major drawbacks to this method,
			such as its reliance on the orbital inclination of the planetary
			system being such that these “transits” are visible from Earth, and
			the inherent presence of noise in the observational data. However,
			this method has found more exoplanets than any other method combined.
			Given that only a fraction of possible exoplanets can be found using
			the transiting method, this means that, statistically, many
			exoplanets exist that simply cannot be discovered using the transit
			method. This also supports the theory that our planetary system is
			not a unique one, and, by extension, that life could exist outside of
			it.
			</p>
			&emsp;&emsp;The only model for a planet that harbors life is our own,
			the Earth, though Mars and Venus could have been habitable in its
			past. There are also multiple moons that could be habitable: Europa,
			Enceladus, Titan, Io, and possibly Ganymede. Given the large number
			of moons in the solar system, and the fact that potentially habitable
			moons do exist, exomoons could potentially hold the same value for
			finding life as exoplanets do. The same methods to detect exoplanets
			could potentially be applied to the discovery of exomoons. However,
			though various methods have been suggested to detect them, no exomoon
			has ever been confirmed. Whether or not a planet could be habitable
			depends on multiple factors: the type of planet and whether it has
			the chemicals needed for life in an appropriate state. Likewise,
			whether or not an exomoon is potentially habitable relies on its
			initial composition. Additionally, the potential habitability of an
			exomoon depends on the distance from its star and planet and radius
			(Lammer, 2014), as well as the stability of its orbit and the maximum
			orbital separation (Kaltenegger, 2010).
			</p>
			&emsp;&emsp;Methods for detecting an exomoon that have been proposed
			so far revolve around two ways that the presence of an exomoon
			changes the transit curve of its exoplanet: Transit Timing Variation
			(TTV) and Transit Duration Variation (TDV) (Kipping, 2011). The
			first, TTV, focuses on how the time intervals between each transit
			could fluctuate based on how an exomoon would orbit the planet.
			However, there are other phenomena besides a moon that have been
			known to cause TTVs, such as trojans (very small bodies that orbit on
			a planet’s outer Lagrangian points) and solar activity. An analysis
			of a system’s TTVs can also lead to finding other exoplanets because
			of their gravitational effects on other planets (Nesvorný, 2013). The
			second way an exomoon could affect a transit curve, TDV, focuses on
			how an exomoon could change the length of transiting itself. When TTV
			and TDV effects agree with each other well, it is very possible that
			the exomoon could exist.
			</p>
			&emsp;&emsp;What I want to do is create a flexible model of a
			sun-planet-moon system that can take various initial conditions, such
			as the semi-major axes of the planet and moon, the radii of the sun,
			planet, and moon, the masses of the sun, planet, and moon, and the
			luminosity of the star. I will then see if the TTVs and TDVs of a
			system are dependent on any of these factors, and if so, which
			factors affect them the most, and why. I will then try to find
			exomoons by looking at a wide spread of available exoplanet
			transiting data, model the given two body exoplanet-sun system, and
			if that light curve is far enough away from the actual light curve, I
			will add an exomoon to my model, find the light curve again, and see
			if this light curve is more similar to the observed transit curve.
			</p>
			&emsp;&emsp;A challenge in modelling a star-planet-moon system is
			that there are more than two bodies acting upon each other. When two
			bodies act upon each other, the resulting model is predictable.
			However, when more bodies act upon each other, the system is
			ever-changing and cannot be predicted. The “three body problem,” a
			case where three bodies act upon each other, has been especially
			researched. There are special cases for three body systems in which
			the model is periodic and solvable. In fact, 13 additional families
			of solutions (Šuvakov, 2013) to the three body problem were
			discovered in 2013, adding to the previous three that were already
			known.

			<h4>Procedure</h4>
			&emsp;&emsp;A Toshiba Satellite S55-A5295 with an Intel Core 3630 QM
			Quad Core with the Windows 10 operating system and a 1 TB hard drive
			and a 12 GB RAM was used. Eclipse Java 2019-06 was downloaded, along
			with an offline version of the Glowscript IDE.
			</p>
			&emsp;&emsp;VPython version 2.9 was chosen after a brief bit of
			research, as it suited all of the needs for the first part of the
			project. Example projects were looked at, and I attempted to make a
			first model using the demos. I emailed Prof. Kipping and Dr Arnold,
			both of whom responded. Primarily using the Glowscript online IDE on
			glowscript.org, I made a three-body model of a star-planet-moon
			system. At first, I tried to do this by working off of the demos
			shown on glowscript.org, notably BinaryStar-VPython and
			Stars-VPython. However, these models quickly broke when I tried
			changing the orbital parameters. I then used the VPython knowledge I
			learned from the demos to make my own model, from scratch. I got the
			two-body system to work, but was unable to debug my code for a
			three-body system. After failing to get the three-body system to
			work, I decided to use the two-body system that I’d already created,
			and made a three-body system using two two-body systems, imbedded in
			each other, so that the planet-moon system was one body system, and
			the sun-(planet-moon) system was another. I then tweaked various
			orbital parameters and downloaded various frames, or screenshots of
			the program at a point in time. I then made a script in Eclipse that
			found all of these frames, and gave values for the amount of light
			present in each. I graphed these data points in Google Docs to get
			the resulting graphs.
			</p>
			&emsp;&emsp;All of the unanalyzed data was uploaded onto Google Drive
			for use as a back-up. All of the collected data can be found <a
				href="https://osf.io/gkqap/quickfiles/" class="link">here</a>
			The data was analyzed on Eclipse. TTVs and TDVs were found by finding
			the start time and end time of each transit, which were then printed
			out, and graphed to see whether there was a direct correlation or
			not. No direct correlation between TTVs, TDVs, and changes in moon or
			planet mass or radius were found, contrary to the initial hypothesis.

		The video above illustrates how the Glowscript IDE was used, and what
		the three body model ended up looking like. The first part of the
		video shows how the data was collected, with the disk of the sun
		visibly transited, and the frames being downloaded. The second part of
		the video shows a top-down view of the modelled system, with the radii
		of the sun and planet multiplied by 10<sup>2</sup> and 10<sup>3</sup>,
		respectively. The third part of the video zooms into the planet-moon
		system, with both the planet and moon radii multiplied by a factor of
		10. The last part of the video illustrates how nothing seems to show
		up when looking at the system with its true size; the sun, planet, and
		moon are all way too small.

	<div class="blob" width="100%">
		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		&emsp;&emsp;As you can see, there is no smooth increase in the TTV or
		TDV for any of the graphs, as would be expected, except for the planet
		radius TDV graph, which is only because the definition of a transit
		would mean that something was seriously wrong with my model if light
		wasn’t blocked for a longer duration of time when the planet had a
		larger radius. Most of the bumps in the graphs can probably be
		attributed to my data not being precise enough. However, I did find
		this really cool phenomenon for each of the individual graphs yeah,
		basically I didn’t get any clear TTV or TDV results. Additionally,
		though my control transit is supposed to have a completely flat
		bottom, it has the same bumps that I experienced earlier with the rest
		of my data:
		</p>
		&emsp;&emsp;So basically, though my data may be precise, it is not
		very accurate. This means that I cannot build a reliable model upon
		it, and would need to collect more data in order to find a model that
		works.
	</div>
	<div class="blob" width="100%">
		<h4>Discussion</h4>
		&emsp;&emsp;My initial goal was not met for this project, as I did not
		end up making an algorithm that would be capable of finding an
		exomoon. I made an exomoon-exoplanet-star model, and found really
		interesting bumps at the bottom of the transit curve that I thought
		might hold some significance, and possibly be some sort of phenomenon
		that hadn’t been observed before. However, when I collected the
		control data, that is data for simply the planet-star model, and thus
		should not have had those bumps, I found that the control data also
		had such anomalies. As I personally have never seen these anomalies in
		scientific literature, and it also wouldn’t make sense physically, I
		would rather say that the data is indicative of an inherent flaw in
		the model I created to model this system, than I have discovered some
		new phenomenon. As such, it would be irresponsible of me to meet my
		initial goal, and code and algorithm to look for exomoons based on
		faulty data. Thus, if I want to make this project useful to the
		scientific community at large, I would need to find the bug in my
		program that is making these anomalies, or switch to another
		program/model entirely.
