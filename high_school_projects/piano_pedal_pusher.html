			<h4>Course Description</h4>
			During STEM 2, we work in groups of three to four people with the
			folks at Seven Hills and Easter Seals to produce specialized
			assistive technology for our clients there. 
		</div>
		<div class="blob">
			<h4>Problem Description</h4>
			Spinal cord injuries are a broad class of injuries that involve
			damage of the spinal cord which transmits signals to and from the
			brain. These injuries often result in limited motor function, making
			it difficult for the patient to move the muscles in their arms,
			hands, feet, and legs. ​This can make it challenging for these
			individuals to complete daily tasks independently, such as brushing
			their teeth, writing, typing, and even playing music. ​The goal of
			this project is to design a device that will allow these individuals
			to independently play an instrument and produce music.
		</div>
		<div class="blob">
			<h4>Approach</h4>
			First we came up with three different project ideas: a guitar pick, a
			trombone slide controller, and a piano pedal pusher. We modelled
			these in CAD and then performed stress analysis on them to aid in
			deciding which of three designs should be further modelled into a
			prototype. This ultimately ended being the piano pedal pusher. Our
			goal with this project was to improve the experience of playing an
			existing device. We decided to focus on helping patients with limited
			range of motion in their legs to play music on the piano while
			utilizing pedals. The model works by signaling for motors to extend
			and retract cylinders which will push down pedals. The motors would
			be connected to an Arduino where each motor is connected to an
			associated button. When the button is pressed, the motor would rotate
			one way to push down the pedal and when the button is released, the
			cylinder would retract and allow the pedal to go back. Below is the
			requirements document that helped us decide which project to pursue.

			<h4>Design 2.1</h4>
					<img class="floatleft" src="../images/stem 2/design21.png"
			style="width: 40%;">
			The initial prototype only included the base, without any sort of
			pushing mechanism, but the intended pushing mechanism was three
			pistons, one at each circular hole.
		</div>
		<div class="blob">
			<h4>Design 2.2</h4>
					<img class="floatleft" src="../images/stem 2/design22.png"
			style="width: 40%;">
			This design added the pistons to Design 2.1. Though these aren’t real
			pistons, they illustrate what actual pistons would look like if
			attached to Design 2.1.
		</div>
		<div class="blob">
			<h4>Design 2.3</h4>
					<img class="floatleft" src="../images/stem 2/design23.png"
			style="width: 40%;">
			This design changed the method of pushing down the pedal from a
			piston to a gear. The gears aren't finished, but they have been
			started. Additionally, the middle and right piano pedal pushing
			plates have been created and a detachable connector that secures the
			piano pedal pusher has been implemented.
		</div>
		<div class="blob">
			<h4>Design 2.4</h4>
		<img class="floatleft" src="../images/stem 2/design24.png"
			style="width: 40%;">
			The final design uses gears to change the positions of the piano
			pedal pushers. These piano pedal pushers consist of a block with a
			piano pedal imprint underneath them, which are attached to a rod with
			teeth on the top of it, which connects to the motor which causes the
			rod to go both up and down. Electrical components still need to be
			added for the device to function.

			<h4>Final Product: Design 2.5</h4>

			&emsp;&emsp;The final device uses gears to change the positions of
			the piano pedal pushers. These piano pedal pushers consist of a block
			with a piano pedal imprint underneath them, which are attached to a
			rod with teeth on the top of it, which connects to the motor which
			causes the rod to go both up and down. We printed out the design, had
			to adjust a few things, and then added the electrical components for
			the device to function. The piano pedal pusher hasn't been tested on
			a piano yet, but preliminary tests indicate that it may be too weak
			to push down a piano pedal.​
			</p>
			&emsp;&emsp;In the near future, we hope to continue progressing this
			project and make some improvements for a more complete final design.
			After running more tests, we would like to make any necessary updates
			the design requires, and produce a more finalized product. Then, we
			would like to be able to meet with the Seven Hills staff and clients
			to show them our product and get feedback. Our end goal would be to
			produce a fully functioning final design that can be used at Seven
			Hills to help clients play the piano and provide them with a positive
			music experience. The Instructables for this project can be found <a
