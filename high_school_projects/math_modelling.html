				My first introduction to the world of math modelling was at the start of my junior year of high school, through the HiMCM competition. Over the course of that year, I participated in two other math modelling competitions, the Mathworks Math Modeling Challenge and IMMC. Through these competitions, I learned how to work in a team to find the resources needed to work out an informed solution to any given problem.

				<h4>HiMCM</h4>
				<a href="https://www.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/index.html" class="link">HiMCM</a> is a COMAP math modelling competition, where groups of four students are given an ambiguous problem and have to find a mathematical model as the solution. My team chose to model the first of the two problems, <a href="https://www.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/2019_HiMCM_Problem_A.pdf" class="link">Charge!</a> and <a href="https://www.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/2019_HiMCM_Problem_B.pdf" class="link">Bottle Battles</a>. This is the final paper that my group submitted to HIMCM. We were designated as finalists, a distinction only given to six percent of all submitted papers.</p>

				<h4>Mathworks</h4>
				The <a href="https://m3challenge.siam.org/" class="link">Mathworks Math Modeling Challenge</a> is a math modelling competition from Mathworks that takes place over twelve hours. However, only two teams from my high school could compete, and luckily I was on one of them. The problem centered around <a href="https://m3challenge.siam.org/newsroom/high-school-students-use-math-gain-insight-electric-trucking-long-haul" class="link">the electricity consumption of semi-trucks</a>, and our final paper is shown below.</p>

				<h4>IMMC</h4>
				After having finished as finalists in HiMCM, our team found that anyone who placed Meritorious or higher in HiMCM qualified for the US Regional round for the <a href="http://www.immchallenge.org/" class="link">International Math Modelling Competition</a>, and if we were one of the top two teams, we would be able to represent the US in the IMMC. However, as the time for the IMMC came around, we realized that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we would not be able to meet each other in person. We decided that we still wanted to participate, and coordinated our efforts over Zoom. The problem centered around the flood of people in flash sales and the resulting damage of store items. We ended up producing a model that relies on two main computer simulations, one a "game" in Python that simulates the amount of products sold based on where each department is placed, and the other a simulation in Java that has people objects come into the store and buy or damage items based on probability (this was the simulation that I mainly worked on). We ended up being one of the top six teams in the United States, with our paper winning a Finalist designation. Our paper is attached below.</p>
