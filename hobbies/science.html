				<h2>Science Olympiad et al.</h2>
				I was a part of CRLS’ Science Olympiad team for these past two years. Freshman year I did Astronomy, Dynamic Planet, and Hovercraft events, and placed 16th, 8th, and 13th, respectively. Sophomore year I did Astronomy, Dynamic Planet, Wright Stuff, and Sounds of Music, and placed 15th, 22nd, 11th, and 9th, respectively. I’m not exactly sure what happened for Dynamic Planet, because my partner and I got 12th and 13th place for the MIT and Harvard Invitationals, which is really good because a lot of top teams compete in them, and as a team we usually haven’t prepared much by then and thus don’t do that great. I did basically nothing for Wright Stuff. Sounds of Music was really fun, but kind of a last minute thing for both my partner and I. I managed to make a PVC pan-flute that was tuned using water, which was a really cool experience. The height of my Scioly career was when I got 6th place in Astronomy for the Harvard Invitational. Also, as a team, we competed in our regional competition, the North Shore Science League, where we got 2nd overall. Our team also helped write the Division B Harvard Invitational tests, of which I helped write the Solar Systems and Water Quality ones. Also, we competed in the Cambridge Science Fair Trivia Challenge, and my teams were a Gold Runner-up and a Silver Runner-up freshman and sophomore year, respectively.</p>

				<h2>Astronomy</h2>
				I absolutely love all things astronomy and astrophysics (especially solar system stuff). I could nerd out about it a lot, but I’m content with reading books and trying to learn more about it. Here's an image from <a href="https://xkcd.com/1522/" class="link">xkcd</a>, a webcomic that comments on various STEM fields. This year, Neena, Izzy, and I will be competing in the <a href="https://usaaao.org/" class="link">USAAAO</a>'s First Round, and hopefully we'll be able to advance to the NAO (National Astronomy Olympiad).</p>

				<h2>Underwater Robotics</h2>
				I joined the Underwater Robotics team sophomore year, after having quit Concert Band from the previous year, which met at the same time. Our team competed in MATE’s Ranger class. I helped design and build the arm and the camera systems.</p>
