				<h2>Sailing</h2>
				I really love to sail. Iâ€™ve sailed at <a href="https://www.community-boating.org/" class="link">Community Boating</a> in the summer every year since I was 9 up until I started Mass Academy, from 9-3 basically every weekday. I managed to get most of my ratings, and sailed for the CBI Race Team for about two and a half years. I was part of my high school sailing team at CRLS mainly as a 420 crew, and won the best skipper-crew team for the division freshman and sophomore year with my skipper. I also managed to get to O'days, a national-level regatta qualifier, in sophomore year with said skipper. I have sailed Mercurys, Rhodes 19s, Sonars, Ideal 18s, Lasers, 420s, and, very briefly, an FJ. Also, I have a love-hate relationship with spinnakers.</p>
