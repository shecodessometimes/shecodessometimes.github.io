				<h2>Project CODY</h2>
				This summer, I mentored elementary, middle, and high school students on the basics of coding through <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~cody/" class="link">Project CODY</a>, a program committed to helping kids learn about computer science. I worked with kids who had little to no coding experience, and taught them about the basics of coding using Scratch and the <a href="https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/s/en/home" class="link">CS First</a> curriculum.</p>

				<h2>Graspable Math</h2>
				During C Term of junior year, I was a part of the Graspable Math elective, and helped with testing <a href="https://graspablemath.com/" class="link">Graspable Math</a>. We would try to find novel ways to break the software, and point out potential confusing factors.</p>

				<h2>Assistive Technology</h2>
				I was a part of the Assistive Technology Club at MAMS during A and B term of junior year, and worked on organizing the already existing e-NABLE parts and building hands. e-NABLE is an organization that allows chapters of the program to make 3D printed mechanical hands, and then distribute them to people in need. </p>

				<h2>Cserkészet</h2>
				I’m half Hungarian, and as such, I’ve participated in Hungarian Scouts since I was 6 or so. Hungarian Scouts, or rather, “Cserkészet”, is basically Girl/Boy Scouts, in Hungarian. You do traditional scouting activities such as knot-tying, nature walks, and camping, but you also do things such as learn Hungarian folk songs, folk dances, culture, and history, all while speaking Hungarian. I’m part of the Bodnar Gabor Boston Group and so I was a troop leader during my first two years of high school. However, sophomore year, because I felt I could not give my best due to the amount of schoolwork and the extracurriculars that I’d been taking, I decided to quit.</p>
