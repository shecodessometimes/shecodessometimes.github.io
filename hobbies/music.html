				<h2>Singing</h2>
				Iâ€™ve been singing since I was very little. My parents are both very musical, my siblings and I have been exposed to a lot of music since we were wee lads. I think I was first introduced to the concept of musicals by watching Disney princess movies and movie musicals such as The Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and Singing in the Rain. For the second half of third grade, I went to a Hungarian choir school in order to improve my Hungarian. I had a tough time there, and got mainly 3 out of 5s, which, having only gotten As prior, I found absolutely devastating. In 7th grade, I was in the RAUC musical, which was a wonderful experience. In 8th grade, I decided to not do the musical because I wanted to do Geometry in order to be on track to do Calculus sophomore year, and believed that I would not have enough time to do both. Suffice it to say, I could not take the Geometry test because I had not studied the subject in person. Freshman year, I auditioned for the CRLS musical but did not get in. Instead, I played the flute in Concert Band, but didn't feel dedicated enough, and decided to change to singing sophomore year, where I was in the A Capella group Tonal Eclipse and the CRLS Travelling Chorus. I also played Dot in CRLS' rendition of Honk!.</p>

				I enjoy listening to musical soundtracks such as The Sound of Music, Man of la Mancha, Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen, and Hadestown. I love how stories can be portrayed by their music, and how the music reflects the change in mood and plot. I also love the beautiful harmonies that often crop up. I've only ever watched 4 musicals, one of which was on Broadway (the Lion King, when I was like 6), but the few shows that I've seen have absolutely blown me away. I've been in two musicals before, and hope to be in more.</p>
